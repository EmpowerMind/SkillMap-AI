# SkillMap-AI
SkillMap AI - Learning buddy acting as career operating system that converts professional profiles into continuously evolving learning systems with real artifacts and verified mastery.

Capstone project
Learning buddy acting as career operating system that converts professional profiles into continuously evolving learning systems with real artifacts and verified mastery.

Acts as a second brain for lifelong learning, helping users organize, distill, and structure knowledge from fragmented sources into a unified, meaningful system.

Instead of hopping across multiple platforms, courses, and tools, SkillMap AI brings all learning content into one place and converts it into curated, distilled, and actionable knowledge.

The platform continuously adapts based on user interactions, reflections, and performance, ensuring learning remains relevant, structured, and outcome-driven.

## Objective
Build a local-first AI learning companion that transforms a user’s professional profile and learning inputs into an adaptive, artifact-driven system for continuous skill growth and verified mastery.

## High-Level Plan
1. Define foundations and architecture
   - Finalize user personas, success metrics, and MVP scope.
   - Design local-first system architecture, data model, and memory representation (`RemMe`).
2. Build core ingestion and knowledge pipeline
   - Implement LinkedIn/resume import and content upload.
   - Normalize and convert all sources into structured Markdown knowledge units.
3. Deliver adaptive learning orchestration
   - Generate daily/weekly personalized plans from goals, activity, and skill gaps.
   - Break content into micro-learning units and prioritize by relevance and urgency.
4. Add mastery and reinforcement loops
   - Create quizzes/flashcards with spaced repetition.
   - Capture reflections, detect blockers, and continuously update skill-gap mapping.
5. Build artifact and productivity layer
   - Support summaries, notes, handwritten practice tracking, and portfolio artifacts.
   - Integrate automation features (e.g., slide/content generation) for faster output.
6. Validate, iterate, and scale reliability
   - Run pilot usage, measure retention and skill progression outcomes.
   - Improve recommendation quality, UX performance, and long-term memory accuracy.

Features
- Local-first web application with rich UI features including Markdown viewer and content upload support
- LinkedIn and resume import with RemMe system for evolving Markdown-based learning memory
- Centralized workspace for unifying fragmented learning sources with automatic Markdown conversion
- Continuous discovery and recommendation of new courses, papers, and learning resources
- Adaptive daily and weekly personalized learning plan generation
- LLM-powered decomposition of content into micro-learning “knudgets”
- Automated quiz and flashcard generation using spaced repetition principles
- Weekly reflection on work areas, questions, and difficulties with automated skill-gap extraction
- 15-minute micro-learning packages with support for reading, typed summaries, and handwritten practice tracking
- Notebook LM integration for automated slide creation and engaging content generation
