Capstone project
Learning buddy acting as career operating system that converts professional profiles into continuously evolving learning systems with real artifacts and verified mastery.

Acts as a second brain for lifelong learning, helping users organize, distill, and structure knowledge from fragmented sources into a unified, meaningful system.

Instead of hopping across multiple platforms, courses, and tools, SkillMap AI brings all learning content into one place and converts it into curated, distilled, and actionable knowledge.

The platform continuously adapts based on user interactions, reflections, and performance, ensuring learning remains relevant, structured, and outcome-driven.
